Founded, curated and hosted by Gina Young, SORORITY exploded almost overnight from a small salon into a huge and supportive community of creators with a cult following. SORORITY events defy description and spark conversation, and we've produced hundreds of artists at venues including The Hammer Museum, Rockwell, and Los Angeles Performance Practice's LAX Festival.
