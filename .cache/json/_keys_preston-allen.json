Full length-musicals include WE ARE THE TIGERS (you can listen to the cast album on all steaming platforms!), NEVER BETTER, AGENT 355 (collaborator Jessica Kahkoska), CARRIE 2: THE RAGE, AN UNAUTHORIZED MUSICAL PARODY, GLITTER CITY, and A VERY NETFL*X CHRISTMAS MUSICAL: NOW STREAMING LIVE! (collaborator Edward Precht). Currently a member of the Ars Nova Play Group and a graduate of the Second City Chicago Comedy Studies Program. I can sometimes be found punking up Andrew Lloyd Weber songs on Twitter or screaming musical theater karaoke in the faces of strangers. Commissionable for everything very silly to viscerally heart-wrenching. Above all, the proud father to my cat, Hero. ","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"preston-allen"}}
