I aim to craft wild, expansive, and curious theatre experiences that use the diversity of my training to redefine theatre-making through an interdisciplinary lens.  From 2014-2017 I co-founded and ran The Queen City Queer Theatre Collective, which hosted monthly readings and development workshops of queered theatre free to the public.\n\nIn addition to my theatre work, I am also a filmmaker and am currently the resident videographer/editor for Signature Theatre Off-Broadway.\n\nInstruments include: Guitar, Drum Set, Accordion, Piano, Saxophone. Let's make something together.\n","resume":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/18DntI5SWU1e2cRSQ1UN6UfS1kcitfkHJ/view?usp=sharing"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"lindsey-augusta-mercer"}}
