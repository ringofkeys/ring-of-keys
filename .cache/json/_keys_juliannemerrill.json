Those kids that get told that they are broken and unimportant? Those kids that are so hurt and lost that they end their lives because they think they are trash and that no one loves them? I want to use my music and my influence as a powerful, queer, female conductor and leader to reach out to them and show them that there is beauty in adversity, that they are perfect and worthy of love, and that it truly does get better.\n","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"juliannemerrill"}}
