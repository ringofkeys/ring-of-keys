Background: My initial training is in Musical Theatre performance. I put out a full length record and toured the country as a singer-songwriter for 5 years- then finally landed back home. Since then, I’ve purposed myself to write new musical theatre music. And often perform that music. And other people’s music. ","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"joanna-burns"}}
