In this hour-long session we'll discuss how to get the best self-tape possible without buying extra gear.

I'm a filmmaker, actor, and musician and my videos have over 1.5 million views between YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram (Rebecca Loops). Right now I'm developing an online dating game show, researching for a feature film screenplay (an American response to Portrait of a Lady on Fire set during Prohibition - queer life was ALIVE back then!!), and when we can safely go to people's homes again I'll finish shooting the first season of my webseries The Handy Lesbian, where I help people with home projects. I've gotten pretty good with a camera and I'm a great teacher, so let's see how this goes!"}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}}}},"startTime":"April 21, 2020","endTime":"2020-04-21T18:00:00+00:00"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"make-your-self-tapes-look-better-with-key-rebecca-marquardt"}}
