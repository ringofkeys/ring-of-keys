I use movement to support the story being told in ways that are engaging and sustainable. I believe that movement is a universal language that can bridge the gap between audience and artistry.\n\nIn my work, I explore known stories through overlooked lenses with my choreography taking inspiration from all things “ooky spooky”. By employing narrative along with an avant-garde aesthetic, I feel any topic can be uniquely explored and discussed.\n\n Dance can be alienating and often has audiences feeling like they have been left behind. My goal in life is to amend this. When I create, I aim to make audiences and creatives alike feel like artists.","resume":"https://2a5e0145-d058-411e-bd7c-7b4f6e2de91a.filesusr.com/ugd/f758ce_a4efa91f56714a2db5a56f5d7fd42fb4.pdf"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"kristen-brooks-sandler"}}
