I am passionate about new works, collaboration, interdisciplinary connections and anything that requires me to learn something new. I have a BA in Music Performance and a Masters of Science in Music in the Community from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland where I studied music and the brain and began exploring community music practices. \n\nI spend most of my free time making clothes and thinking extensively about the connections between queerness and clothing. I am also currently writing a collection of essays about my experience growing up in, leaving and slowly healing from the evangelical pentecostal tradition.
