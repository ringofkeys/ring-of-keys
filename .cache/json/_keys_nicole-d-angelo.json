I originally went to college to be a classical clarinetist, but was super unhappy on that path. Around that time I saw FUN HOME and was blown away by seeing a leading lady wearing jeans and a polo, and the rest is history! I now work closely as a teaching artist and actor with EPIC Players, a professional neurodiverse theater company which serves performing artists with developmental disabilities, and am a music director at the French Woods Festival for Performing Arts.
