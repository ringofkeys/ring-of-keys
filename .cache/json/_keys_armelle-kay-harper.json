I can't express how happy I am to have found a community of LGBTQ women+ with whom to make art & share experiences!\n\nI am most interested in exploring themes regarding the conflict inherent in being an LGBT woman of color and how it manifests itself in the face of larger, overarching societal & personal conflicts. Other fascinations lately have been the Big Questions brought around by the concept of ethics and, not unrelated, how much actual happiness can be derived from convenience. My main creative influences are my 23andMe results, Dorothy Parker, Michael Shur, and the MTA.","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"armelle-kay-harper"}}
