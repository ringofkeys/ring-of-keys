Margaret considers herself a fluid theatre artist that desires to work on projects from many different avenues, but does see herself first and foremost as a director - thinking usually in a broad, full scope and then pinning down details from there. \n\nAdditionally, she hopes to bridge the gap between artistic work and activism, finding ways that art can create measurable action with societal norms, protest, and legislature.
