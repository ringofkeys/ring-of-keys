Feminist. Aquarius. \n\nGrowing up glued to my tv in a small town in the smallest state, I dreamed of leaving the beautiful beaches and woods of Rhode Island, moving to the bustling island of Manhattan, and becoming an actress. So far so good? I came to New York to study musical theatre at Marymount Manhattan College.  There I immersed myself in both artistry and academia - studying acting, voice, movement, dramaturgy, history and writing. Currently you can find me auditioning in Midtown, working on the East Side, and dreaming my best life in my 2nd floor apartment. I hope to continue bringing new works and complex characters to life on stage and screen.","resume":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQAONBmUh6zbuzGHJu7rauceJ_y3FvA1nD3-rhQkd3M/edit?usp=sharing"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"michelle-houle"}}
