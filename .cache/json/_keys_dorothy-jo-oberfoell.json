I'm Dorothy Jo! I'm (at the moment) a Midwest-based actor. I'm a recent grad from Viterbo University in La Crosse, WI with my BFA in Theatre: Acting Emphasis. Most recently I've performed in New Jersey and Pittsburgh. Along with acting, I am a freelance show choir choreographer and clinician. When I'm not on stage I can be found fangirling over vintage fashion, sewing and doing DIYs, practicing yoga, & exploring coffee shops. ","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dorothy-jo-oberfoell"}}
