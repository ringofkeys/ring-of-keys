Through my storytelling, I seek to authentically add joy to people's lives and  allow people to feel fully seen and represented.  Playing is the name of my game in the rehearsal room/on stage/on set so that we can find & create the most authentic version of the story at hand. I love to tell stories through acting, dance, movement, & song.   \n​\nMy passion and drive for storytelling, dancing, acting, & singing started at the early age of three & has never waned since. I've been fortunate to work in theatres  across the Chicagoland & New York regions creating new works from the ground up & bringing fresh perspectives to classic stories. \n​\nI graduated with a BFA in Musical Theatre with a minor in Psychology from The Chicago College of the Performing Arts at Roosevelt University in Chicago. Today, I am continually training in NYC at the Jen Waldman Studio, Eddie Schnecker Studio, The Pit, Maxtheatrics, & the Heidi Marshall Studio.","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"kelsey-andres"}}
