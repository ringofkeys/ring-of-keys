My name is Mollie and I am a queer performer born, raised, and living in NYC.  I was playing my dream role of Roxie Hart on the Broadway National Tour of “Chicago” before we were forced to socially distance, but I am trying to stay creative by playing around on my ukulele and keyboard, painting, coaching online classes, and cuddling with my cats (duh).  Always looking for new collaborations, so please reach out if you’re looking for someone to create with! ","resume":"https://www.molliedownes.com/resume"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mollie-downes"}}
