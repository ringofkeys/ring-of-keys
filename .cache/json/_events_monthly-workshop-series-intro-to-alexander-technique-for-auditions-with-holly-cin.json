By orienting to various resources in your environment, you will discover scene partners all around the room, your nervous system will feel calm and supported and you will remain grounded over your feet throughout your audition. When you are at the center of your experience and your performance is fully embodied, the camera and the casting director will be drawn to your incredible presence and you will lead them through the journey your character takes throughout your audition material. Kick the habit of feeling ungrounded or losing your power when you enter the audition room by understanding how your nervous system finds support in any environment.\nPlease bring in something to work on: song, monologue or scene.
