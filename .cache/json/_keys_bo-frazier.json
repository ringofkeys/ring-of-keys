My interests include poetic, riveting and radically inclusive works that highlight trans and BIPOC narratives while queering the dramatic form. Whether it be new plays, experimental theatre, movement or music-theatre I bring a choreographic approach to every step of the process. With my deep-rooted need for community, I am excited are excited by the creative discoveries in the room to create a cohesive ensemble and strong aesthetic world. Growing up in Mike Pence’s Indiana, I found my chosen family in musical theatre – away from the constant bullying I experienced at Heritage Christian School. I studied musical theatre at Millikin University and went on to star as Hinckley in the 2012 London Revival of Sondheim's Assassins. Yet now in 2020, I look back and see the problematic exclusions within the musical theatre canon that we love so dearly. Musical Theatre as a form is so queer and non-traditional, yet our narratives remain extremely white-cis-heteronormative. As a a plus-size, transfeminine, non-binary, neurodivergent, and queer person, I never learned my own history and I have never seen anyone on stage like me in my life; literally never. \n\nWORK EXPERIENCE: While in London, I got my start as director of the Off-West End Premiere of Neil Simon’s The Dinner Party, Associate Directed bare: the rock musical for Olivier Award-Winning Paul Taylor-Mills, co-founded the Offie-Award nominated theatre London Theatre Workshop. While at London Theatre Workshop, I created their Musical Theatre Lab (endorsed by four-time Olivier Award Winning Musical Theatre Director Timothy Sheader) where I developed a music/theatre piece that went on to a West End run. In NYC, I formed my own multidisciplinary collective developing experimental interdisciplinary work at Dixon Place, served as Associate Producer for Heartbeat Opera, directed for the Rutgers University MFA/BFA Acting program and was a finalist for The Drama League fellowship. \n\nCURRENT PROJECTS:  I am building a theatre company in Chicago with my dear friend and bi-racial artivist Isabel Dayson. We will be dedicated to making work with/for/about/by BIPOC, trans and queer folks of all abilities. Through Socratic leadership style, we aim to take down the patriarchal corporatization of theatre institutions to be a new model for success in American Theatre. If you are in Chicago I would LOVE to chat with you! MEMBER SDC\n\n","resume":""}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bo-frazier"}}
