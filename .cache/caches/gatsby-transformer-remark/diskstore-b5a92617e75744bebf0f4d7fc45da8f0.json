By orienting to various resources in your environment, you will discover scene partners all around the room, your nervous system will feel calm and supported and you will remain grounded over your feet throughout your audition. When you are at the center of your experience and your performance is fully embodied, the camera and the casting director will be drawn to your incredible presence and you will lead them through the journey your character takes throughout your audition material.
