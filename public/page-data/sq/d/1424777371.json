You were the first person she thought of! \n\nHere’s what I wrote:\n\n\"I’m looking for bookwriter/dramaturg who writes comedy, has a good sense of humor and disdain for political correctness, who is not afraid of shocking an audience or poking fun of lots of different types of people. Do any of your Keys come to mind?\"\n\nIf that sounds like you :) and you think you might have 30-minutes to look over some of the show, I can send you some materials. Or if you prefer, we can set up a Zoom call first and I can fill you in on the project before sending anything.\n\nIn short, the musical is cast for 5F/2M. The three biggest roles are female identifying: a witch, a lawyer, and a dancer. There’s a body swap, a lovable Italian baritone, and a dog. The show also has a lesbian relationship. \n\nAt this point, I’m interested in finding a collaborator who can provide a new perspective on the story, who may or may not become an actual member of the writing team. All the details of an arrangement would be negotiable.\n\nI hope all is well in Oakland. I think of Oakland often because I teach at Berklee College of Music, and we are often confused with UC Berkeley. My wife and I have visited several times and love the area.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.\n\nKevin Bleau\nAssociate Professor, Berklee College of Music\nMusical Theater Writer\n  CORONA BROs\n  Awaken Youth\n  Roswitha\n  If You Want My Body\n  The Mission\nkevinbleau.com\nkevin.bleau@gmail.com\n","toArtist":{"name":"Bayla Travis"},"meta":{"timeDiff":"24","timeSince":"24 days ago","timeString":"11/12/21"}},{"fromEmail":"michael.zegarski@tososnyc.org","fromName":"Michael Zegarski","message":"Hello!\nI am Michael and am the ED of TOSOS, www.TOSOSnyc.org\nWe are NYC’s longest Producing LGBTQIA+ theater company.

I'm a NYC based (currently quarantining in my hometown of Louisville, KY) actor, et al, creator and advocate. I am also a queer, non-binary womxn (bi/pan, she/they pronouns) and recently joined Ring of Keys. I saw that you are casting Block Association for Actors Theatre of Louisville and I learned about this Key Messaging service through one of the cofounders of RoK and so I wanted to reach out. I would absolutely love to be considered for the role of Emma. I feel like I'm a great fit for the character based on the breakdown and I am super passionate about working on projects dealing with queer issues and playing queer characters. I did voice over for a show at Actors as a very young child (Ali in the 90s) and have been called back as an actor a few times over the years when I've gone in for projects there such as The Children's Hour and Our Town. Like I said, I'm typically based in NYC but am currently living in Louisville, KY so I can work as a local hire. I submitted to the project via Actors Access and my manager and or agent may reach out as well (I'm obviously dying to be seen for this.) But I thought I'd try to contact you here as I'd love to connect with you regardless of if you feel I'd be a good fit for this particular project.

I am a playwright and a fellow Ring of Keys member. As I've been finding myself with a lot of free time in quarantine, I'm hoping to make some new connections with directors and other artists, especially queer artists like myself, and first found out about you and your work through your site-specific production of Fun Home (which I tried, to no avail, to get tickets for!). I feel like I know a lot of queer actors but far fewer queer women directors (despite being a queer woman playwright and really wanting to work with directors of similar identity!), so given all this time on my hands, I was hoping perhaps you similarly have time on your hands and might be interested in \"getting coffee\" over Zoom? I'd love to chat. \n\nHope to hear from you soon, \nAudrey Lang","toArtist":{"name":"Daniella Caggiano"},"meta":{"timeDiff":"472","timeSince":"a year ago","timeString":"08/21/20"}},{"fromEmail":"andershunneson@gmail.com","fromName":"Ander Shunneson","message":"Hello!
