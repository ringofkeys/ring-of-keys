                Our identities have a history of being whispered in our industry. This is, in fact, how we met. But our friendship
                was born out of a mutual desire to shout our identities from the rooftop. We realized that while we inhabit a professional
                space that is gay-friendly, queer women and TGNC artists are underrepresented within that space, despite being a huge and
                vital part of the industry. So we started Ring of Keys (with Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori's blessing, of course).
                What began as two queer sopranos eating cheese in a new york city apartment is now a sprawling professional network
                of 300 members representing 40 cities throughout the United States, including London and Toronto. Welcome to the Ring.
                Do you hear our hearts saying hi?

                Ring of Keys is a national network of queer women, transgender, and gender non-conforming artists working professionally
                on and offstage in the field of musical theatre. The only network of its kind, our membership is made up of actors,
                directors, dancers, singers, stage managers, lighting designers, dramaturgs, artistic directors, producers, casting directors,
                librettists, lyricists, composers, props, designers, scenic designers, sound designers, choreographers, costume designers,
                and production managers who self-identify as lesbian, bisexual, trans, queer, femme, masc, non-binary, and the diversity of
                genders that queerness contains. We strive to kick (ball-change) the closet door open to create a vibrant, diverse musical
                theatre landscape for the future.

            <p>
                Ring of Keys promotes the hiring of self-identifying queer women, transgender, and gender non-conforming artists
                in the musical theatre industry. We elevate the work of queer musical theatre artists through showcases, our social
                media platforms, and our monthly newsletter. We provide a visible, supportive community for our Members, with a focus
                on networking events, job-sharing, and monthly meet-ups. In addition, we collaborate with arts organizations and community
                partners to mobilize our industry to advance the musical theatre landscape and queer the stage.
