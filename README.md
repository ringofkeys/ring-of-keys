# Ring of Keys

A website directory and resource center for theatremakers.

This site was created using [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.com). It pulls content from [DatoCMS](https://datocms.com), is hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and does some clever stuff with [Auth0](https://auth0.com) to make editable user profiles possible on a JAMstack site!

If you are interested in developing this site or using it to build your own feel free to reach out to @franknoirot or fork it. I recommend reaching out first because there are definitely some lessons learned that haven't been fully corrected in here just yet.
